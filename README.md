## What did I learn from this project?

It was my first time using react-spring, so it was nice to become familiar with the ease this library gives you to animate DOM elements, specially with mounting and unmounting components (such as the loading screen).

It is also the first time I built a project with Vite, and it was surprising to see how fast it is and how much it speeds up development time.

And finally, in getting to build a website in two languages, I learned a lot about global states and particularly the useContext hook.
